        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

<!--6. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:

   * If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   * If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   * So on and so forth.

7. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

8. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.

   * Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
   * Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

9. Push your changes to Github.

### Additional Specifcations

1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._
   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:
   * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * Use a picture of yourself.
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:
   * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Background Images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

6. Dimensions:
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html).

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
   * Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).
   * Give the Footer the following CSS:
   * border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;

### Helpful Hints

* For help with Git and GitHub, be sure to consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide sent to you in class.

* Don't forget to look into these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.

* This will be a tough assignment, but towards the end of the course, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive! You've got this!

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit the link to the Github Repository!
